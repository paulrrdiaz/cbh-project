This project contains two challenges - a "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and a "Refactoring" challenge. The two challenges are unrelated, but you should complete both in the same folder and share the link in Coderbyte. Any written answers should be included in markdown files within this folder.

## [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md)

## [Refactoring](Refactoring.md)

If you are a JS novice, here's how to get started:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we use `^16`, the latest LTS) and [yarn](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-the-yarn-package-manager-for-node-js)
2. Run `yarn` in this repo to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn test` to run the automated tests (`yarn test:watch` is available too)
4. Run `yarn start` to launch `index.js` for any manual testing
